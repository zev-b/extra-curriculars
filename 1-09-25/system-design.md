## 1. Foundations of System Design
This area covers the building blocks of any system. Understanding these concepts helps you tackle problems systematically.

- Scalability: The ability of a system to handle increased load by adding resources.

    - Example: Facebook serves billions of users. If they gain millions of new users, their system should scale up seamlessly.
    - Key Concepts: Horizontal scaling (adding servers), vertical scaling (upgrading servers).
- Reliability: Ensuring the system performs as expected, even during failures.

    - Example: Banks ensure transaction consistency even if there's a server crash.
    - Techniques: Redundancy (multiple backups), monitoring systems.
- Components: Familiarize yourself with:

    - Load Balancers: Distribute incoming traffic across servers to prevent overload.
    - Databases: Store and retrieve data. Learn about relational (SQL) vs. non-relational (NoSQL) databases.
## 2. Key Topics to Study
- Client-Server Architecture: The backbone of most systems.

    - A client (browser/app) sends requests to a server (backend). The server processes the request and sends back a response.
    - Example: You open Twitter; your browser (client) fetches tweets from Twitter’s servers.
- Databases:

    - SQL: Structured and uses tables (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL). Great for complex queries.
    - NoSQL: Flexible and optimized for scalability (e.g., MongoDB, DynamoDB).
    - Concepts like indexing (for faster lookups) and sharding (splitting data across servers) are essential.
- Caching:

    - Stores frequently accessed data temporarily for faster access.
    - Example: Netflix caches thumbnails of movies on CDN servers, so you see them instantly.
- Queues:

    - Allow asynchronous processing.
    - Example: You upload a video to YouTube; the upload is quick because the video is processed (compressed, transcoded) in a queue in the background.
- CDNs:

    - Content Delivery Networks store data closer to users to reduce latency.
    - Example: YouTube stores video copies worldwide to minimize buffering.
## 3. System Design Process
When solving a system design problem, structure your thoughts:

- Understand Requirements:
    - Functional: What the system does (e.g., stores photos).
    - Non-functional: Performance, scalability, reliability (e.g., handles 10M users).
- Draw High-Level Architecture:
    - Include components: clients, load balancers, servers, databases.
- Discuss Trade-Offs:
    - Example: SQL databases are structured but harder to scale compared to NoSQL.
- Iterate:
    - Add more features or layers (e.g., security, monitoring).
## 4. Example Problems
Here’s how to think through some common problems:

__URL Shortening Service (e.g., TinyURL)__
- Requirements:
    - Shorten a URL.
    - Redirect users when they click the shortened link.
- Components:
    - Web server: Accepts the URL, generates a unique key.
    - Database: Maps keys to original URLs.
    - Cache: For frequent lookups.

__Scalable File Upload System (e.g., Google Drive)__
- Requirements:
    - Upload files of any size.
    - Share and download files.
- Components:
    - File storage: AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage.
    - Metadata storage: SQL or NoSQL database.
    - Queue: To process file indexing or virus scanning.

__Real-Time Chat App (e.g., WhatsApp)__
- Requirements:
    - Send and receive messages in real-time.
    - Store chat history.
- Components:
    - WebSocket connections for real-time communication.
    - Database for storing chat history.
    - Cache for frequent chats.
