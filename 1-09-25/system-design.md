## 1. __Foundations of System Design__
This area covers the building blocks of any system. Understanding these concepts helps you tackle problems systematically.

- __Scalability__: The ability of a system to handle increased load by adding resources.

    - __Example__: Facebook serves billions of users. If they gain millions of new users, their system should scale up seamlessly.
    - __Key Concepts__: Horizontal scaling (adding servers), vertical scaling (upgrading servers).
- __Reliability__: Ensuring the system performs as expected, even during failures.

    - __Example__: Banks ensure transaction consistency even if there's a server crash.
    - __Techniques__: Redundancy (multiple backups), monitoring systems.
- __Components__: Familiarize yourself with:

    - __Load Balancers__: Distribute incoming traffic across servers to prevent overload.
    - __Databases__: Store and retrieve data. Learn about relational (SQL) vs. non-relational (NoSQL) databases.
## 2. __Key Topics to Study__
- __Client-Server Architecture__: The backbone of most systems.

    - A client (browser/app) sends requests to a server (backend). The server processes the request and sends back a response.
    - __Example__: You open Twitter; your browser (client) fetches tweets from Twitter’s servers.
- __Databases__:

    - __SQL__: Structured and uses tables (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL). Great for complex queries.
    - __NoSQL__: Flexible and optimized for scalability (e.g., MongoDB, DynamoDB).
    - Concepts like indexing (for faster lookups) and sharding (splitting data across servers) are essential.
- __Caching__:

    - Stores frequently accessed data temporarily for faster access.
    - __Example__: Netflix caches thumbnails of movies on CDN servers, so you see them instantly.
- __Queues__:

    - Allow asynchronous processing.
    - __Example__: You upload a video to YouTube; the upload is quick because the video is processed (compressed, transcoded) in a queue in the background.
- __CDNs__:

    - **C**ontent **D**elivery **N**etworks store data closer to users to reduce latency.
    - __Example__: YouTube stores video copies worldwide to minimize buffering.
## 3. __System Design Process__
When solving a system design problem, structure your thoughts:

- __Understand Requirements__:
    - __Functional__: What the system does (e.g., stores photos).
    - __Non-functional__: Performance, scalability, reliability (e.g., handles 10M users).
- __Draw High-Level Architecture__:
    - __Include components__: clients, load balancers, servers, databases.
- __Discuss Trade-Offs__:
    - __Example__: SQL databases are structured but harder to scale compared to NoSQL.
- __Iterate__:
    - Add more features or layers (e.g., security, monitoring).
## 4. __Example Problems__
Here’s how to think through some common problems:

__URL Shortening Service (e.g., TinyURL)__
- __Requirements__:
    - Shorten a URL.
    - Redirect users when they click the shortened link.
- __Components__:
    - __Web server__: Accepts the URL, generates a unique key.
    - __Database__: Maps keys to original URLs.
    - __Cache__: For frequent lookups.

__Scalable File Upload System (e.g., Google Drive)__
- __Requirements__:
    - Upload files of any size.
    - Share and download files.
- __Components__:
    - __File storage__: AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage.
    - __Metadata storage__: SQL or NoSQL database.
    - __Queue__: To process file indexing or virus scanning.

__Real-Time Chat App (e.g., WhatsApp)__
- __Requirements__:
    - Send and receive messages in real-time.
    - Store chat history.
- __Components__:
    - WebSocket connections for real-time communication.
    - Database for storing chat history.
    - Cache for frequent chats.
