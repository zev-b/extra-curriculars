1. Foundations of System Design
- Understand scalability and reliability concepts.
- Learn about common components like load balancers, caching, and databases.
- Familiarize yourself with database design basics (e.g., normalization, indexing).
- Understand how to design APIs, including REST and GraphQL.
2. Key Topics to Study
- Client-server architecture: Understand how clients interact with servers.
- Databases: SQL vs. NoSQL, sharding, replication.
- Caching: Redis, Memcached, and where to use caching.
- Queues: Message queues like RabbitMQ or Kafka.
- CDNs: How content delivery networks improve latency.
- Load balancing: Techniques to distribute traffic.
3. System Design Process
- Break the problem into manageable components.
- Start with requirements: functional (what it does) and non-functional (e.g., scalability).
- Draw out high-level architecture diagrams.
- Discuss trade-offs and constraints.
4. Example Problems
- Design a URL shortening service (like TinyURL).
- Design a scalable file upload system (like Google Drive).
- Design a real-time chat application.
