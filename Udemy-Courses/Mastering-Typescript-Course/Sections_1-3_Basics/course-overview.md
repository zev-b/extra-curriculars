# What is Typescript?
- Javascript is quirky. null * number = 0. No error is thrown. Undefined * number = NaN. No error is ever thrown in these circumstances, which allows silent errors in computation a lot of the time.
- The reason is since JS was created for basic scripting, but changed and became a beheamouth of a language as it is today, so the imperfectins of the language are magnified.
- Typescript is a super set of JS.

# Types:
- Static Checking:
    - Looks for errors in the code, without executing it. 
    - Even before runtime. 
    - In development, 
    - and then compiled into JS for Production.
