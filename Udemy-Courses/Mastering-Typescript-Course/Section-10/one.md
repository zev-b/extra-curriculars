Intro to the Compiler:
- When the typescript file is run using the `tsc file_name.ts` command, the compiler creates a new file for the javascript equivalent of the T.S. code.


# Configuring Typescript:
- `tsc --init`
  - This makes a `tsconfig.json` file that has a lst of settings with explanations about each of the settings.
