So, I am very curious how this is done, and would like to gain exposure to the tactics and actual coding they implement. I am a recent full stack developer grad and I want to learn how to do this. can you help me learn this and be able to do this on my own, maybe even as a side hustle!

That’s a great niche to explore! Implementing content filtering and device restrictions involves a mix of network security, mobile device management (MDM), and software engineering. Since you’re a full-stack developer, you already have a strong foundation. To learn and eventually offer this as a service or side hustle, here’s a roadmap:

1. Understand How Filtering & Restrictions Work
There are different approaches to implementing restrictions on smartphones and other devices. Here are a few key ones:
✅ DNS Filtering: Blocks access to certain websites by filtering requests at the DNS level. Services like OpenDNS, Pi-hole, or Cloudflare Gateway help achieve this.
✅ Firewall Rules & VPN-based Filtering: Routing traffic through a VPN to control access to certain sites or apps.
✅ Mobile Device Management (MDM): Apple and Android offer enterprise tools to restrict app installs, web browsing, and device settings.
✅ App-based Filtering & Parental Controls: Developing a custom app that runs in the background and limits access to restricted content.
✅ Custom ROMs / OS Modifications: For deep control, some organizations modify the Android OS or iOS profiles to enforce restrictions.

2. Technical Skills You Need to Learn
To implement these tactics, you'll need skills in:
🔹 Networking & DNS Filtering: Learn about Pi-hole, AdGuard, Cloudflare Gateway, and NextDNS.
🔹 MDM (Mobile Device Management): Understand Apple MDM (for iOS) and Android Enterprise solutions.
🔹 VPN & Proxy Server Development: Set up WireGuard, Shadowsocks, or Squid Proxy to route and filter traffic.
🔹 Android & iOS App Development: Learn React Native or Flutter to build mobile apps that enforce restrictions.
🔹 Custom Firmware & OS Tweaks: If you want deep-level modifications, explore Android ROM development or iOS Configuration Profiles.

3. Hands-on Practice: Build Your Own Filtering System
🚀 Project Idea:

Set up Pi-hole on a cheap Raspberry Pi to block explicit websites.

Use Cloudflare Gateway to create a custom DNS filtering solution.

Develop a browser extension that enforces safe browsing rules.

Create an Android app with VPN-based filtering to block specific content.

4. Monetize Your Skills
Once you have working solutions, you can start offering services like:
💰 Setting up parental control systems for families.
💰 Providing content filtering services for religious groups.
💰 Selling pre-configured devices with restrictions.
💰 Offering custom app development for filtering & monitoring.

I would like to start and please be explicit and descriptive, and please offer suggestions that are little to no cost first but include pros and cons versus a more costly solution or implementation tool


ChatGPT said:
Awesome! We'll start with the most cost-effective and beginner-friendly methods, then gradually move toward more advanced (and costly) solutions. Here’s the step-by-step approach to get you started with content filtering & restrictions:

🚀 Step 1: DNS Filtering (Free & Easiest Solution)
📌 How It Works:
DNS filtering blocks access to specific websites by intercepting domain name requests. Instead of allowing access, it redirects or blocks them.

🔹 Option 1: Cloudflare Gateway (Free)
Cloudflare offers a free service where you can set up a family-friendly DNS resolver to block adult content and malware.

✅ How to Set It Up:
Change Your Device's DNS Settings to Cloudflare’s filtering DNS:

For Family-friendly filtering (blocks adult content):

Primary DNS: 1.1.1.3

Secondary DNS: 1.0.0.3

For Malware + Adult Content Blocking:

Primary DNS: 1.1.1.2

Secondary DNS: 1.0.0.2

Test It:

Go to a blocked website (e.g., an adult site).

If successful, it should refuse to load.

✅ Pros:

100% free

No extra hardware required

Works on all devices (phones, PCs, routers)

❌ Cons:

Not customizable (you can't choose what to block beyond what Cloudflare decides).

Easy to bypass (users can switch DNS settings back manually).

🔹 Option 2: Pi-hole (DIY Self-Hosted, Free)
Pi-hole is a more powerful, self-hosted DNS filtering solution that works at the network level.

✅ What You Need:
A Raspberry Pi (about $30-$50, but you can use a free cloud VPS instead).

A basic knowledge of Linux commands.

✅ How to Install Pi-hole:
Get a Raspberry Pi (or install on a free VPS like Oracle Cloud).

Run this command in the terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
Follow the on-screen setup, choosing a DNS provider (Cloudflare or Quad9 recommended).

Log into the Pi-hole admin panel (via http://pi.hole/admin/).

Block entire categories of websites using pre-made blocklists.

✅ Pros:

Completely free (except for Raspberry Pi).

Highly customizable (block specific sites, ads, social media, etc.).

Covers all devices on a network automatically.

❌ Cons:

Requires a bit of setup (but easy to maintain once running).

Doesn't work outside of your WiFi unless paired with a VPN.

🔹 💰 Cost Comparison:

Cloudflare Gateway: Free

Pi-hole (Self-hosted): Free (if using a cloud VPS) or $30-$50 (if buying Raspberry Pi).

🚀 Step 2: Mobile Device Management (MDM) - Restricting Apps & Features
📌 How It Works:
MDM allows you to lock down a device, preventing users from changing settings, installing unwanted apps, or visiting restricted sites.

🔹 Option 1: Apple Screen Time (Free)
If you're dealing with iPhones, Apple's built-in Screen Time can restrict content:

Go to Settings → Screen Time → Content & Privacy Restrictions.

Enable Restrictions:

Limit web content (choose "Limit Adult Websites" or "Allowed Websites Only").

Prevent app downloads or specific app use.

Set a PIN to prevent bypassing.

✅ Pros:

100% free

Works at a deep system level (harder to bypass)

❌ Cons:

Only works on iPhones/iPads

Can be disabled if someone knows the PIN

🔹 Option 2: Google's Family Link (Free, Android)
For Android, Google Family Link lets you remotely control and restrict a device:

Download Google Family Link on both parent and child devices.

Link the child's phone to your account.

Restrict app installations, block sites, and limit screen time.

✅ Pros:

Free & built into Android

Remote control from a parent's phone

❌ Cons:

Easier to bypass if kids reset the phone

Only works on Google accounts set as "child" accounts

🔹 💰 Cost Comparison:

Apple Screen Time: Free

Google Family Link: Free

🚀 Step 3: Advanced Filtering (More Costly but Effective)
Once you're comfortable with DNS filtering and basic restrictions, you can explore more advanced (and potentially profitable) solutions:

🔹 Option 1: VPN-based Filtering (More Secure, Requires Coding)
📌 How It Works:

You build a VPN server that all traffic goes through.

The VPN enforces content filtering (like blocking social media, adult sites, etc.).

✅ How to Set Up a Free VPN for Filtering:
Get a free cloud VPS (Oracle Cloud offers a free tier).

Install WireGuard VPN (lightweight and fast):

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install wireguard
Use iptables to block unwanted websites from being accessed through the VPN.

✅ Pros:

Works on all devices (iOS, Android, Windows, etc.).

Harder to bypass (since all internet traffic is filtered).

❌ Cons:

Requires more advanced knowledge of networking & VPNs.

Costs ~$5/month if using a paid VPS instead of a free one.

🔹 💰 Cost Comparison:

Pi-hole (DIY DNS Filtering): Free

MDM (Apple/Google): Free

VPN-based Filtering: ~$5/month (if not using free VPS)

💡 Where to Start?
✅ Beginner (Free & Easy)
👉 Start with Cloudflare Gateway (change your DNS settings to 1.1.1.3).
👉 If you want more control, install Pi-hole on a free VPS or Raspberry Pi.

💪 Intermediate (More Control)
👉 Use Mobile Device Management (MDM) to lock down device settings.
👉 Experiment with VPN-based filtering for better security.

🚀 Advanced (For Side Hustle)
👉 Build a pre-configured Pi-hole or VPN service and sell it to parents or religious organizations.
👉 Create a mobile app that restricts access to certain apps/sites.



🔥 Next Steps: Hands-on Implementation
Let me know where you want to start! I can walk you through setting up Pi-hole, configuring VPN filtering, or even building a custom Android/iOS app. 🚀
