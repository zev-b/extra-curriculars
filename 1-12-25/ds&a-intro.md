## Step 1: Arrays
- __*Definition*__: A collection of elements, identified by index or key, stored in contiguous memory locations.

__Key Characteristics__:

- Fixed size (in low-level languages like C).
- Allows random access using indices.
- Ideal for scenarios where elements are accessed sequentially or randomly.

__Common Operations__:

- Accessing elements: 
𝑂
(
1
)
- Searching for an element: 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
(linear search), 
𝑂
(
log
⁡
𝑛
)
 (binary search for sorted arrays)
- Insertion (at the end): 
𝑂
(
1
)
; at a specific index: 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
- Deletion: 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
 (due to shifting elements)

__Use Cases__:

- Storing sequential data like daily temperatures, stock prices.
- Building more complex data structures like heaps and stacks.

__Example Problems__:
> __Two Sum__: Given an array of integers and a target sum, find two numbers such that they add up to the target.

*Example*: Input: `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]`, `target = 9 -> Output: [0, 1]`

> __Maximum Subarray__: Find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum.

*Example*: Input: `nums = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]` -> `Output: 6 (subarray [4, -1, 2, 1])`

__Practice Problems__:
- Implement a function to rotate an array

steps to the right.
- Merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array.
- Find the intersection of two arrays.
